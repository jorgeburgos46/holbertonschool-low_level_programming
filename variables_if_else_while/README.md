Variables, if, else, while

Description

This project introduces the basics of programming in C. It focuses on understanding variables, data types, conditional statements (if, else if, else), and loops such as while and do/while.

The goal is to build a strong foundation in low-level programming by writing simple programs that use logical conditions and repetition structures.
