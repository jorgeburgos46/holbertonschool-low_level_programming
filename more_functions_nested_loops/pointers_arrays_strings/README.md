# Pointers, Arrays and Strings

This project is part of the Holberton School low-level programming curriculum.

## Description

In this project we practice the fundamentals of:

- Pointers
- Memory addresses
- Arrays
- Strings
- Passing arguments by reference
- Dereferencing pointers

The goal is to understand how memory works in C and how to manipulate values using pointers.

## Learning Objectives

- What pointers are
- How to use pointers
- How to access memory addresses
- Difference between value and address
- Arrays and pointer relationships
- Basic string manipulation

## Files

- `main.h` - Header file containing function prototypes.
- `0-reset_to_98.c` - Function that updates the value pointed to by a pointer to 98.

## Compilation

Example:

```bash
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 file.c -o output
